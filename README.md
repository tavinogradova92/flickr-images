## What I could implement in this project


Project created with React

External API (Flickr) fetching JSON data (please, let me know in case it does not work any longer, it should though).

Tachyons tool (pre-built CSS) for quick design.

Flexbox.

Custom font being implemented.

Media queries for responsive layout.

Search through titles working dinamically.

Error Boundry implemented for error handling.

Github commits, git.


## What I can also do, but did not implement in this project


Redux.

Adobe XD (the way UX Designers work are of great inspiration for me and having photography background I also would like to go deeper into styles and UX design).


## What I would like to learn to do

Unit tests.
